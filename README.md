# Interactive-Form
This project adds JavaScript to a make it more user-friendly.  There is customized and conditional behavior and interactivity along with input validation with meaningful error messages.  I added real-time error message validations to the Name, Email and Credit Card input fields.  When a user starts typing in these fields, the related validation helper functions are run and will display whether or not the input is valid.
