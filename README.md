# Interactive-Form
This project adds JavaScript to a make it more user-friendly.  There is customized and conditional behavior and interactivity along with input validation with meaningful error messages.  I added real-time error message validations to the Name, Email, Register for Activities, and Credit Card input fields.  When a user starts typing in these fields, the related validation helper functions are run and will display whether or not the input is valid.  The email field will also show conditional error messages.  If the the field is empty, the error message states that the field is empty.  If the email contains an invalid domain, the error message states that the domain is invalid and provides an example of a valid domain.
